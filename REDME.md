# üç≤ Food Rescue App

Connecting surplus food from restaurants and events directly to NGOs that serve our local community.  
This project was made for [Hackathon Name] with one simple goal: **don‚Äôt let good food go to waste!**

---

## Why This Matters

Every day, so much food gets thrown away while people in need go hungry.  
I wanted to build something practical that helps bridge this gap using technology.  
The app matches food donors with NGOs in real time, making the rescue process quick and easy for everyone.

## Features

- Easy dataset import for both food donors and NGO partners  
- Interactive **Dashboard** showing total portions, active offers, and NGO count  
- **Risk Monitor** that automatically scores food donations (low, medium, high) based on freshness, packaging, and pickup deadlines  
- Urgent action alerts for high-risk food so it doesn‚Äôt get wasted  
- Detailed NGO directory, including contact info, capacity, and specialization  
- Smooth, mobile-friendly design with Tailwind CSS and animations

## How It Works

1. Try the live demo: https://thrishi1011.github.io/Food-Rescue-App/
2. The app automatically:  
   - Updates the **Dashboard** with stats  
   - Lists NGOs in the **NGO Network**  
   - Scores donations in the **Risk Monitor** (green = low risk, yellow = medium, red = urgent)

## Tech Stack

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React (CDN version for easy setup)  
- Tailwind CSS for styling  
- Framer Motion for smooth transitions  

---

## Sample Data

- `offers.csv`: Food donors, restaurants, events  
- `ngos.csv`: NGO partners and contact info

## Future Plans

- Add WhatsApp integration so restaurants can send offers automatically  
- Build a live map feature so NGOs and donors can connect visually  
- Smarter AI-powered matching between donors and NGOs
